-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I have no previous experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript other than being familiar with them, knowing how they look like and how they work. So i guess it's safe to say i familiar with them but
not actual experience with them. I have not worked with them like i have now in this course.

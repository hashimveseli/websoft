<h1>My report page in the course websoft.</h1>

<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>So, a presentation might be in order. I'll begin.</p>

<p>My name is Hashim Veseli. I was born and raised in a small city in Småland called Markaryd. We moved down to Kristianstad when i was 12. I used to go to Österänggymnasiet and now I study computer science in Högskolan Kristianstad. My passions are family, friends and football. I play in a local team called Nosaby IF. Besides football and school, i work in a LSS-home. </p>

<p>Programming has always been an interest of mine. Since i was a child i have used computers and always been interested in knowing how they work. So i've been the "tech-head" in my family.</p>

<p>Another hobby of mine is going to the gym. I love to clean my thought and just play music really loud and just go nuts on the weights! Love the feeling after. </p>

<p>That was a brief introduction to who i am. As it looks now this course is going to be great!</p>

<h1>A report from the course webwoft by Hashim Veseli.</h1>

  <h3>Assignment S01</h3>
  <p> I have used Git and GitHub before on a couple of courses throughout the years, but Markdown and GitHub Pages is new to me. All the courses where we have worked on a project, Git and GitHub have been involved. It was very hard for me to understand how it worked in the beginning but once i got my hands on it i learned it and found out how helpful it was for programmers.
<p> I have never created a whole website before but i tried it out a couple of times. Just basic stuff. I am super excited to be interacting with websites in this course because i always wanted to learn that and i knew this course will come in the last semester, now we're here! </p>
<p> My experience with web application development is mostly from the course "Network Applications" we had this autumn. There, we learned to work with e.g. REST Api and JSON through client-server applications. </p>
<p> Today i learned and repeated a lot. Using the terminal correctly with git was repetition but using Atom was new. I learned how the text editor, terminal and GitHub go hand in hand. I learned more concepts on GitHub and an insight of how to work with Markdown.</p>
</div>

<h3>Assignment S02</h3>
<p> I have no previous experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript other than being familiar with them, knowing how they look like and how they work. So i guess it's safe to say i familiar with them but
not actual experience with them. I have not worked with them like i have now in this course.
<p> As i understands it, HTML and CSS are not programming languages but text editors (markup languages and style sheet languages), where HTML defines the structure of your content and CSS defines the style of the content.</p>
CSS is more like 'rules' applied to a HTML document that you have in a external file whereas HTML is what you write when developing a website. Then you have JavaScript which is a dynamic programming language that can provide
dynamic interactivity on websites. Summary: all of these work together to provide the best website possible.
<p> The browser is just an "application" you use to be able to reach the web and to read websites. Web servers are just computers who run websites and HTTP Protocol was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers. </p>
<p> Today I Learned a lot actually! I learned how to interact with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. How to work with a markup program (Atom) to create a website and how to add links and pictures to a website.</p>
</section>

<h3>Assignment S03</h3>
<p>I do not have any previous experience with JavaScript at all but i have quite been familiar with the purpose of client side JavaScript when designing websites. Now, thanks to this course, I am now familiar with the JavaScript environment.</p>
<p>The difference between JavaScript and Java (the language we mostly used so far) is that Java is a compiled and interpreted language who is first compiled into class files then executed on the JVM, while JavaScript code is directly executed by the browser. I feel like they are pretty similar so I have'nt had a problem coding JavaScript so far.
While Java is a programming language, JS is a scripting language who doesn't need to be compiled; code is all in text. </p>
<p>For the grade, I started with reaching a grade 3, then 4 and then 5. It was fun to do this assignment because it meant doing fun stuff to your webpage e.g. the moving duck and the flags. That is the reason I reached grade 5 and a nice piece of code. </p>
<p>My TIL for this course section is actually pretty informative and instructive. I learned to fetch from the school API, make a picture dynamic (duck) on the website and to work more in detail with CSS (flags). </p>

<section>
<h3>Assignment S04</h3>
<p>Node and npm are completely new for me. It took a while for me to understand what they are and how they work but once
i got through the "tutorials" you provided, i understood. Also, very good lectures so far Mikael! Thanks to them, i
now feel good about working with JavaScript, Node and Express. The structure on canvas with all the information you need
is helping me a lot. Once i sit and play around with javascript, node and express for a couple of hours, i feel like it
would be more comfortable to work with and more fun. Just got to get there!
<p>I took on the coding assignment just as i took on the exercises for Node and Express. Same way of organizing and structuring
the code. That was the plan and yes it worked, no problems! </p>
To start with i just aimed for grade 3 because i thought it seemed difficult in the beginning when reading about the subject.
Now that it is finished, i will try to aim for a higher grade of course.
<p/>My TIL for this course section was basically to build an web application using Node and Express and to structure the files
along with the code.</p>

<h3>Assignment S05</h3>
<p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>
<p>PHP is a good multi-purpose scripting language that can handle a lot of tasks as it provides dynamic websites. We can use php to create, update, delete and read files on servers and databases. At first it took some time getting used to the syntax but i learned quickly so i would say it is easy to learn.
<p>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
<p>It has similar syntax as C programming language. </p>
<p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
<p>I aimed for grade 3 at the beginning but got caught up in these tasks so i ended up doing the tasks in grade 4 and 5. Honestly im satisfied with getting a good grade in this course so i can move on to the next one and then prepare for graduation!</p>
<p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
<p>My TIL for this course section is: i learned to work with PHP and saw the benefits of working with it in comparison with HTML, CSS and JS. Also gained some knowledge about mySQL databases. </p>
</section>

<h3>Assignment S06</h3>
<p>As you might know by now is that I only coded Java the last couple of years so I dont have any experience with C and Python who are the most popular languages after Java. I feel like these big coding languages are good to know but that these upcoming new languages like C#, Swift and Go are even better to get a grip on these days due to the new technology of phones. </p>
<p>For the project in this websoft course we will be using C# which is getting popular with time and has climbed in the list of top programming languages 2020. Last year C# was in place 7 and now its in place 5 soon passing C++ above. </p>
<p>I used Google Trends to compare C# and .NET from all around the world and the results were interesting. The whole world map was covered in blue (C#) but there was some countries covered in red (.NET). This meant that these countries prefered .NET over C#. In Spain they were almost equal with 57% .NET and 43% C#. However in Vietnam .NET had 78% and in Nigeria 68%! So my conclusion is that C# is more popular around the world. </p>
<p>My recommendations on a languages/frameworks would probably be to use JavaScript for frontend and backend and perhaps React/Redux for structuring and performance. </p>
<p>Today I: reflected and compared programming languages and frameworks which led to me getting better knowledge on the different languages and frameworks.  </p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Assignment S07</h3>
<p>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</p>
<p>C# is a object oriented programming language used when developing backend in ASP and it is designed for the easy use in practically any purpose. ASP.NET is the web framework/server side script language provided for web development under .NET framework. </p>
<p>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</p>
<p>Because of the fact that it took quite some time for me to get a hand of .NET, i actually would prefer other frameworks such as NodeJS/Express when working with smaller projects because i think they are simpler to use but when working with bigger projects i would say that the structure of .NET makes it better to work with. I also found it harder to find useful information online when searching for .NET compared to other technologies we used in the course.</p>
<p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
<p>I actually only aimed for grade 3 because of the time. I am satisfied with the result because i got to learn the basics of this platform too, and that is always a plus!</p>
<p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
<p>I learned what kind of projects you should use .NET with and what projects you should not. I learned how to create a basic web application with C# and how to use different classes "Models and Services" in the program.</p>

<h3>Assignment S08</h3>
<p>Myself and Andr√© Sandin decided to analyze three equal social media websites to be able to see how they differ and which one stands out and why. We chose these three social media giants because they are very popular and we feel like they need to have high performance. It will be interesting comparing the performance of these three websites. </p>
<p>Devtool Network tab analysis can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYnfV1c1aMznVcffMicaet_SPyzsbMhyrDhK_ipEdAA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>!<br />
<p>PageSight Analysis of the three social media giants Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, you find <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjiEpW-DaVZZ6rMs-1BMzeSaQNKlLGZ3zBcatoI9Ajs/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>!<br />
<strong>Summary:</strong> Instagram.com gets the best performance score where basically the only downside is the formats of the pictures need to be more modern. </p>
<p>LightHouse Analysis of Facebook you find <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vpi67_nioqfvWtB969oaECapwtar58bMvzglE9I1KD4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>!<br />
<strong>Summary:</strong> Facebook.com has the worst performance of the three. We can see that time for the page to become fully interactive is almost 1 minute! Slow speed index and first CPU idle. Could save a lot of time if images and formats are fixed along with minimizing main thread. The page is not fast enough for mobile networks and does not provide a response 200 when page is offline. </p>
<p>LightHouse Analysis of Instagram you find <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xdQt2hFCo2WIVe8u4_W-_ghCfXwQklLSnVh9lweK0ic/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>!<br />
<strong>Summary:</strong> So, Instagram.com has a fast and reliable page load on mobile networks but does not provide a respond with a 200 when a page is offline. Also it does not provide any fallback content when JavaScript is not available and could save some performance time if it efficiently could encode images and serve images in next-gen formats. Also, reducing the impact of third party code and minimizing main-thread work would increase performance. </p>
<p>LightHouse Analysis of Twitter you find <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V1nC9_TrflQ2Lb1kIiJrkmgwCoQQvUq7zRmn27yskuU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>!<br />
<strong>Summary:</strong> As we can see with Twitter.com, the page load is not fast enough on mobile networks. The page load is too slow and not interactive within 10 seconds mosly because of overload on the main thread and on the JavaScript execution time. That is the main reason the performance is bad on this website. Then there are other aspects as reducing the impact of third party code and avoiding enormous network payloads. </p>

<h3>Assignment S09</h3>
<p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability lets a hacker execute his own JavaScript code which can lead to the hacker being able to reveal your chats with friends and get your password. This could lead to someones social media being hacked and these days you could gain profit from hacking a famous instagram page or whatever. Security Misconfigurations is the most commonly seen issue and occurs when a system is configured in a way that makes it vulnerable and can happen on any level of the application stack (in the web server, the database, the web application and network equipment and so on). These flaws give attackers unauthorized access to system data or functionality which can lead to very negative outcome. And last but not least, Injection is one of the web security vulnerabilities that can happen in any kind of system such as:  </p>
<p>- A PHP page sending data to a MYSQL database</p>
<p>- A Python script using system() commands</p>
<p>- A program sending user input to a mail server</p>
<p>- A car dealership and their contract..</p>
<p>Injection can result in data loss, corruption, or disclosure to unauthorized parties, loss of accountability, or denial of access and sometimes lead to complete host takeover. This makes Injection a dangerous security breach. </p>
<p>My guidelines to follow for a secure web application are: </p>
<p>* You need to protect your application with a web application firewall (WAF) that specifically analyzes web traffic and blocks any attempt to exploit vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting or code injection. </p>
<p>* Scan for web-specific vulnerabilities, For example, security scanners, like Netsparker, ensure that no exploitable code gets to the production environment. But there could be logical vulnerabilities that can only be detected by manual code auditing.</p>
<p>* Turn off unnecessary functionality: A basic, common sense tip is to reduce the number of potentially vulnerable entry points. If attackers can exploit any of the components of the web server, the whole web server could be in danger.</p>
<p>* Keep an eye on server logs: Administrators should monitor them regularly to detect any suspicious behavior before it does any damage. By analyzing log files, you can uncover a lot of information to help you better protect the application.</p>
<p>* Use separate environments for development, testing, and production! </p>
<p>* Restrict access and privileges! </p>

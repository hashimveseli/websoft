<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    This website is part of the "websoft" course
    <a href="https://www.hkr.se/kurs/DA377B/kursplan">DA377B</a>
    at HÃ¶gskolan Kristianstad.
</p>

<p>
    This website is continously updated with new features in order to complete the different assignments
    handed out by the professor. Hopefully by the end of this course I will be quite familiar with the different techniques and tools
    used in web-development.
